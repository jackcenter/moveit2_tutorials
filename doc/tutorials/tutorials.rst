In these tutorials, the Franka Emika Panda robot is used as a quick-start demo. Alternatively, you can easily use any robot that has already been configured to work with MoveIt - check the `list of robots running MoveIt <http://moveit.ros.org/robots/>`_ to see whether MoveIt is already available for your robot. Otherwise, you can setup MoveIt to work with your custom robot in the tutorial section "Integration with a New Robot", below.
