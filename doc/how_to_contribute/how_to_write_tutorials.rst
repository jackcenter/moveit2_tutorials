How-To Write a Tutorial
=======================

Tutorials are the most one of the most useful contributions you can make because they are the first thing many new users see.
Tutorials should have these qualities:

* learning by doing
* inspiring confidence
* repeatability
* immediate sense of achievement
* concretness, not abstraction
* minimum necessary explanation
* no distractions
* no options or decisions

Building a Project
------------------

Tutorials should follow this basic pattern:

1. Introduction with a short preview of what the user will learn
2. Action steps the user takes
3. Conclusion to summarize what was learned

In the end the reader should feal a sense of accomplishment.
In order for that they have to take some actions that they were instructed to.
We should avoid the pattern of having a pre-made program that the user just executes followed by a explinations of the code.
Ideally each tutorial should extend the previous one to make them feel connected.

Concrete, not Abstract
----------------------

Tutorials are not the place for explaining nuanced abstractions or discussing dicisions.
In order to foster learning by the newest users they should build muscle memory around using the varous components in MoveIt to do specific tasks.

When a user is going through the tutorials, we should avoid distracting them with potential rabbit holes as that'll detract from the experience of the tutorials.
Save detailed explinations for the :doc:`/doc/concepts/concepts` pages on this site.
Place links to external sties and other resources at the end of the tutorial.

Reviewing Tutorials
-------------------

It is important that the tutorials are reivewed by those that are as close to the intended audience in their amount of experience with MoveIt.

Awesome Examples
----------------

Here are some awesome examples to draw inspiration from for creating tutorials:

* `ROS 1 Tutorials <http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials>`_
* `The Rust Book <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>`_
* `CUDA Toolkit <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#introduction>`_
* `libuv book <http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/guide/introduction.html>`_
* `React Native Docs <https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started>`_
